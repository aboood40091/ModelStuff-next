# REDPRO2
Decompilation of New Super Mario Bros. U v1.3.0 US.  
The scope of this project is unclear. Initially, it was just the decompilation of the graphics system in NSMBU. However, I found myself decompiling more from NSMBU as needed for research and documentation purposes. Maybe this will reach 100% in 50 years :D.  
See Sead for matching policy.
